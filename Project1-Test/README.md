# Cypress Project for ParaSoft Demo Website

Welcome to the Cypress project repository for testing the ParaSoft Demo Website, also known as ParaBank. This repository contains automated tests written using Cypress, a powerful testing framework for web applications.

## About ParaBank

ParaBank is a demo site utilized for demonstrating Parasoft software solutions. It is designed to simulate a realistic online banking website. However, it's important to note that **ParaBank is not a real bank**. All materials within this demo website are used solely for simulation purposes.

   ```

## Test Structure

The tests are organized within the `cypress/integration` directory. Here's a brief overview of the test files and their purposes:

- `login.cy.js`: Contains tests related to the login functionality of ParaBank.
- `account.cy.js`: Includes tests for various account-related functionalities such as balance checking, transfers, and bill payments.
